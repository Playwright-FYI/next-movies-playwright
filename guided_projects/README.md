# Guided Projects: Let's Test the Next.js Movies App E2E, with Playwright ðŸŽ­

## About: Guided Projects

These are mini-labs that have the following characteristics:
 - They should take less than 1 hr to complete.
 - They are self-contained (no installs needed)
 - They have step-by-step instructions for guidance.
 - Any pre-requisities (e.g., knowledge, accounts) are identified.

Guided projects are particularly great for those who learn best by doing a hands-on activity that takes a learned concept and applies it in practice.
